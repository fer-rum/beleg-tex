\section{Suggested Improvements}

	Being still in early development, \emph{q2d} still requires work to become more comfortable for users and further ease the design and evaluation process.
	Component libraries and generator algorithms for certain component types further reduce the effort, the user needs to undertake to obtain a customized component type.
	\Gls{ui} improvements will further enhance the users ability to perceive and interpret the configuration computed by the tool.
	A lot of additional features can be imagined, extending the range of application for this tool such as
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item the export of configured designs as \gls{hdl},
	\item the extension of the model to support stateful components, and
	\item adding interfaces for custom plug-ins.	
	
	\end{itemize}
	
	In the end, users working with the tool will be the best source for improvement suggestions.
	It is their experiences, made while using the application, that should be made as rewarding as possible.
